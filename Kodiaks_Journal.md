# Day 1

## Rookie Village, before the Hunt for the Boar
We talked to Wolf today. He keeps Rookie Village protected. Seems to a good guy.
They mentioned sth about Factions. *Of course there is a gang war in the zone...* 

Upon my Question what Factions are active within the zone he started to count them on his fingers:
He mentioned `Duty`, `Freedom`, `the Military`, `the Ecologists`, some `Fanatics`, but another Group that starts with `K? C?` seems like he didnt wanted to talk about them further... He is well equipped. *Curious...*


Further, he talked to some other guy who wanted to go north, `to a place called Rostock` apparently. Cant remember much about him but it seems like he is another guy that seems to be ready for whatever is ahead of him.
He wanted to sneak by `the Checkpoint` at nighttime? Wolf mentioned you can bribe those instead. Hm.. sounds like a Military Checkpoint from what they told. `The Military` seems to be rather ruthless. I made my own fair share of encounters with them the last few days. Its a miracle they didnt notice my equipment yet. I should stay far away from these folk in future, dont wanna risk my luck...

## The Hunt

Once we went out to find and hunt this pack of boars they sent us to hunt, we have been accompanied by a Stalker called Sasha, which seems more expierenced and equipped suitable for the task. It appears that Wolf send that stalker with us to watch over us, to see how we muster ourselfs... 

The spot where those boars have been seen last isnt far from the Rookie Village, but still, we took the opportunity to chat with Sasha. We asked about these boars and why they send us to kill some local fauna. Said that these are not normal boars, the zone left their mark on them. We've been a bit sceptical, but we have been proven wrong very soon. 

Once we arrive in the area, we can see some wierd phenomena in the forest, sparkling Electricity in the in the air it is kind of like a sphere somewhat floating above the ground. We ask Sasha what that is and the Stalker explained "This is an Anomaly, believe me, you dont wanna go near it".  My curiosity has been struck and soon enough, I carefully pull my MF camera out of my backpack and carefully take a photograph of that *Anomaly*, when i was about to put it back in my backpack, Sasha raised his head, gesturing us to stay quiet and pointed towards the road ahead of us. Just for moment we could see some sort of animal disappear behind a bush.

Quietly we we hush into cover. I move towards a nearby tree and peak around it to see if i can catcha glimpse of what we just encountered without scaring it away. After a few moments of scilence, that animal came back into the open and started to forage through the leaves on the floor in search for food. 

On first sight from a distance, it didnt seem much different from a wild boar, but with closer look, while its moving around and jumping on a rock, more and more scars and deformities are notable - its actually far from a boar, but more like a mutated farm pig. With the camera still in my hand, I take another photograph of this `walking hunk of flesh` while the others seem to prepare their upcoming encounter with that beast.

After I put my equipment back in the bag and reach for my rifle, I setup myself where I stand and point my rifle towards *that thing*. I look to my left and right, observe the others of the group, who are hiding behind trees and bushes, observing the animal. I cannot say that there was much of plan that has been prepared, nor could I observe any initiative by the others, equipped mostly with pistols and sawn-off shotguns - they all have been a hesitant and just looking at the monster from a far, unsure what to expect from it. While leaning against the tree, I pressed the buttstock of this old hunting rifle into my shoulder and look down the irons towars the pig... 

Its been a while since I have been hunting with my grandfather back home, but the memories of those times came back swiftly and combined with my expierence as a photographer - to take aim and hold it steady, even under stressful circumstanced surely contributed.

What to aim for? Point the rifle towards its shoulder and try to pierce its thick, scared leathery skin to take a shot at the heart? No, that skin looks way to tough and even if I can penetrate its leather, will it hit the heart, if that foul beast still has one and take it down? - Head it is. I empty my lungs and hold my breath, I pull the trigger. 

A loud bang echoes through the forest, other animals in the distance can be heard. I lower the rifle and look at my target. Where one of his eyes used to be, now,  there is a gushing bulletwound. Its tumbling, its weak, but still alive. And Angry. With supprise I prepare to reload the rifle, but from the side of my view, I notice Alexej, with his Machete in his Hand, run towards that boar. 

From here, everything happend really fast. More boars show up. Even some Dogs. Attracted by the gunfire. People start shooting and moving closer. Then, suddenly from our front right, we hear the sound of a loud and violent, electrical discharge! To our luck, it seems like one of those blind dog, distracted by the smell of blood, ran straight into said anomaly. One problem less, i think, while pulling out my pistol and moving out of cover, towards the animals that are coming towards us. But just a mere moment later, it seems like our luck has been depleted.

"What the fuck is that?!?" The earth starts to shake and in the distance, a huge, wild boar appears and stampedes down the pathway towards us. With supprise i move to the side by some bushes. I feels some heat nearby, but didnt pay much attention at that moment as there was eno, to get out of its way but Alexej wasnt so lucky! The mega boar charged at him and he flew through the air and hit the ground where he was standing. As the huge beast was about to continue its mauling of Alexej, Zarkk who was on the other side next to Alexej took a shot at beast, which in turn, angrily, focused its attention towards Zarkk, but it seemed he had a plan! Before the spawn of hell was able to charge at him, Zarkk already ran towards the sparkling anomaly which took down the blind dog earlier - it seems like he wants to taunt the beast into a trap! Smart thinking, but to no avail.

I took a shot at another boar which was threatening Alexej who was knocked out the ground, not able to defend himself. The boar goes down, as it was already weakend from the firefight before. But to my supprise, the gigantic beast, instead of charging at zarkk, now turned its ugly face towards me and locks its bloodthristy stare on me. "ah fuck". 

As I stumbled away, seeking distance from the beast, another loud noise behind me - like a flame thrower and a loud painful squeal. I care not to turn around and take my legs in my hands instead and keep booking it towards a big tree. While running, i have the slight smell of Bacon in my nose, but due to the circumstances, i didnt further follow up on said thought, instead i hide behind the tree and look for the beast.

Scorched by fire, hairs still buring, the beast is even more enraged at me and stampedes directly at me, but it seems to be somewhat weakend now. I take my chances and drop my pistol and reach for my combat knife. The moment it reaches me, i keep the tree between us while trying to take a slash at it. I was able to hit it, but its skin, charred and thick, seemed unimpressed by my attempt. "Fuck that!" and i ran towards the rest of the group, who, by now, seemed to have dealt with the rest of the rot and finally point their attention towards my struggle with the boarus giganticus. Meichler vaults towards the boar with his knife, it seems he has a better swing at it and actually hurts it and shortly after, the beast is finally dead.

Out of breath i look around me while
