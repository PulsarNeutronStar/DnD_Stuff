# Day 1

## Rookie Village, before the Hunt for the Boar
We talked to Wolf today. He keeps Rookie Village protected. Seems to a good guy.
They mentioned sth about Factions. *Of course there is a gang war in the zone...* 

Upon my Question what Factions are active within the zone he started to count them on his fingers:
He mentioned `Duty`, `Freedom`, `the Military`, `the Ecologists`, some `Fanatics`, but another Group that starts with `K? C?` seems like he didnt wanted to talk about them further... He is well equipped. *Curious...*


Further, he talked to some other guy who wanted to go north, `to a place called Rostock` apparently. Cant remember much about him but it seems like he is another guy that seems to be ready for whatever is ahead of him.
He wanted to sneak by `the Checkpoint` at nighttime? Wolf mentioned you can bribe those instead. Hm.. sounds like a Military Checkpoint from what they told. `The Military` seems to be rather ruthless. I made my own fair share of encounters with them the last few days. Its a miracle they didnt notice my equipment yet. I should stay far away from these folk in future, dont wanna risk my luck...

Day 2 Pre Combat: 
I ask Wolf: "So those Bandits, if we cause truble with them, they're just scum of the zone, no one will care us taking care of a couple of them, right?"
Wolf smurks. "Hah, if you say scum, you talk about the Renegades - They are even worse then the Brotherhood. But to be honest, the Brotherhood arent much better. But they kinda stick togehter. Word might go around. But they caused us a lot of trouble here in rookie ville, tahts why we kick them back to garbage."

Older Stalker shows up. Talks to Wolf in the Camp. Seems to be better equipped then us. Lost eye, covered by patch. 
Old, beard, trench coat with some sort of protection below.
I choose to listen in on what they talk and hide: 
"They are just stories." "Be careful, what paradise you wish for, what hope you give to other stalkers." in the search they just make it real". 
sth sth about the men in white.

Raid on those wierd ass Bandits.
Wolf appointed a new Kid in the village to our party. Wierd little fella, seems very confused. She introduces herself as Aris. Small girl, very small... Seems like she has a few screws loose. Oh well.


2. Day Combat:

It is time to move.

Sgt and me setup in cover, eyeing the two guys guards at the entrance. PM Makarov left, Sawn-Off Shotgun right.
I wave to Sgt. Point at the two guysthat drunk Private try 
Shot and together with the Sgt., we take out the first guy.
I miss a secound shot while i try to cover Sgt. To my bad luck, i miss. He's angry, the blasts his shotgun and pulls out a grenade.
Sgt dashes away, yelling at them "Learn to shoot, fuckers".
I take the opportunity, I aim and shoot at the grenade, i hit, he's gone. A finger smacks the tree next to my face and falls to my feet. "Fuck me!"

I reload my Rifle and another guy raises his Pistol and walks towards at the Sgt. He takes a shot but his Pistol fails catastrophically and blows up. What a baffoon, clean your gun like it is your yunk.. i think.. then again, they're bandits... i shake my head and put the bullets in the double barrel.
I take aim at the guy. I yell at the Sgt. "Get out of there!". As i ready my shot, the bandit disappears behind the tree, fuck. A deep breath. I reenforce my stance, i lean against the tree and wait. I hold my breath, everything around me seems to slow down. 
moments turn into secounds, secounds into minutes.

There he is, the bandit sprints out from behind the tree and leaps towards the sgt. i flinch my eyes, i press the trigger. 20+5. 
A mist of blood fills everything field of vision. Lowering the gun, i look at the result of my work. I glimpse at the bandit falling like a lifeless puppet, his lifeblood splatters in all direction as the bullet has pierced his head with quite some damage. Poor Sgt., he needs to wash his cloths.

For a moment i thought i can take a breather, but no. I hear a door open loudly in the camp. I look over, through the open gate I see a man step out of the building, with a long rifle, cant make it out exactly. He starts sprinting towards the gate but due to the broken fence, its hard to aim. 
I hold my breath again, focus on the new comer and wait until i have a good chance to take a hit.

It seems like i am lucky, he crosses behind the gate, he jumps up the wall of the building next to the gate. He seems to struggle, i take my chance. A loud bang. He falls and is prone, i try to shoot again. *clack* fuck, i need to reload.
While i reload the rifle
