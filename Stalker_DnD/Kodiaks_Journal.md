# Day 1

## Rookie Village, before the Hunt for the Boar
We talked to Wolf today. He keeps Rookie Village protected. Seems to a good guy.
They mentioned something about Factions. *Of course there is a gang war in the zone...* 

Upon my Question what Factions are active within the zone he started to count them on his fingers:
He mentioned `Duty`, `Freedom`, `the Military`, `the Ecologists`, some `Fanatics`, but another Group that starts with `K? C?` seems like he didnt wanted to talk about them further... He is well equipped. *Curious...*


Further, he talked to some other guy who wanted to go north, `to a place called Rostock` apparently. Cant remember much about him but it seems like he is another guy that seems to be ready for whatever is ahead of him.
He wanted to sneak by `the Checkpoint` at nighttime? Wolf mentioned you can bribe those instead. Hm.. sounds like a Military Checkpoint from what they told. `The Military` seems to be rather ruthless. I made my own fair share of encounters with them the last few days. Its a miracle they didnt notice my equipment yet. I should stay far away from these folk in future, dont wanna risk my luck...

## The Hunt

Once we went out to find and hunt this pack of boars they sent us to hunt, we have been accompanied by a Stalker called Sasha, which seems more expierenced and equipped suitable for the task. It appears that Wolf send that stalker with us to watch over us, to see how we muster ourselfs... 

The spot where those boars have been seen last isnt far from the Rookie Village, but still, we took the opportunity to chat with Sasha. We asked about these boars and why they send us to kill some local fauna. Said that these are not normal boars, the zone left their mark on them. We've been a bit sceptical, but we have been proven wrong very soon. 

Once we arrive in the area, we can see some wierd phenomena in the forest, sparkling Electricity in the in the air it is kind of like a sphere somewhat floating above the ground. We ask Sasha what that is and the Stalker explained "This is an Anomaly, believe me, you dont wanna go near it".  My curiosity has been struck and soon enough, I carefully pull my MF camera out of my backpack and carefully take a photograph of that *Anomaly*, when i was about to put it back in my backpack, Sasha raised his head, gesturing us to stay quiet and pointed towards the road ahead of us. Just for moment we could see some sort of animal disappear behind a bush.

Quietly we we hush into cover. I move towards a nearby tree and peak around it to see if i can catcha glimpse of what we just encountered without scaring it away. After a few moments of scilence, that animal came back into the open and started to forage through the leaves on the floor in search for food. 

On first sight from a distance, it didnt seem much different from a wild boar, but with closer look, while its moving around and jumping on a rock, more and more scars and deformities are notable - its actually far from a boar, but more like a mutated farm pig. With the camera still in my hand, I take another photograph of this `walking hunk of flesh` while the others seem to prepare their upcoming encounter with that beast.

After I put my equipment back in the bag and reach for my rifle, I setup myself where I stand and point my rifle towards *that thing*. I look to my left and right, observe the others of the group, who are hiding behind trees and bushes, observing the animal. I cannot say that there was much of plan that has been prepared, nor could I observe any initiative by the others, equipped mostly with pistols and sawn-off shotguns - they all have been a hesitant and just looking at the monster from a far, unsure what to expect from it. While leaning against the tree, I pressed the buttstock of this old hunting rifle into my shoulder and look down the irons towars the pig... 

Its been a while since I have been hunting with my grandfather back home, but the memories of those times came back swiftly and combined with my expierence as a photographer - to take aim and hold it steady, even under stressful circumstanced surely contributed.

What to aim for? Point the rifle towards its shoulder and try to pierce its thick, scared leathery skin to take a shot at the heart? No, that skin looks way to tough and even if I can penetrate its leather, will it hit the heart, if that foul beast still has one and take it down? - Head it is. I empty my lungs and hold my breath, I pull the trigger. 

A loud bang echoes through the forest, other animals in the distance can be heard. I lower the rifle and look at my target. Where one of his eyes used to be, now,  there is a gushing bulletwound. Its tumbling, its squeling in pain. Its weak, but still alive and very Angry. With supprise about the resiliency of this monster, I prepare to reload the rifle, but from the side of my view, I notice Alexej, with his Machete in his Hand, run towards that boar.

Another loud bang. The flesh falls to the ground, one last shivering but then, scilence for brief moment. The Sargent stands to my left with his pistol in his hand still aiming at the beast.

From here, everything happend really fast. More flesh and boars show up. Even some Dogs - attracted by the gunfire. People start shooting and moving closer. Then, suddenly from our front right, we hear the sound of a loud and violent, electrical discharge! To our luck, it seems like one of those blind dog, distracted by the smell of blood, ran straight into said anomaly. One problem less, i think, while pulling out my pistol and moving out of cover, towards the animals that are coming towards us. But just a mere moment later, it seems like our luck has been depleted.

"What... is this?!?" The earth started to shake and in the distance, a huge, gigantic, wild boar appears. His hide is covered with many scares and even some bulletwounds, but all of them are old and healed. Its stampeding down the pathway towards us. Filled with a mix of fear and supprise, I move to the side, out of its way, towards some bushes behind a rock, near some trees. I feels some heat nearby, which i didnt pay much attention towards as i was busy saving my self becoming boarfeed. I was lucky enough to react in time to avoid certain pain, but not for Alexej! The mega boar charged at him whacked him with his huge head. Alexej flew through the air and hit the ground where he was standing. As the huge beast was about to continue its mauling of Alexej, another even louder bang! Zarkk who was on the other side of the boar, near to Alexej, stand there, with his sawn-off shotgun in his hands, both barrels still smoking. 

With an angry, deeply growling squeal, the beast turned towards Zarkk, but it seems that he anticipated that! Before the spawn of hell was able to charge at him, Zarkk already started sprinting, away from the beast and towards the behind of the sparkling anomaly, which took down the blind dog earlier! What a genious! He wants to taunt the beast into a trap! Smart thinking, but to no avail.

While all that took place, I pulled my pistol as there was a further, be it smaller, boar, that took interest in Alexej who was defenseless on the floor, trying to crawl away from the situation. I took a shot. The boar goes down, as it was already weakend from the firefight before. But to my supprise, the gigantic beast, instead of charging at zarkk, now turned its ugly face towards me and locks its bloodthristy stare on me. The Sargent from somewhere behind me yells "Get the fuck out of there"! The only thought that I could hold in my mind at that point: "...ah fuck" 

I turn around and stumble away, seeking distance from the beast, another loud noise behind me - like a flame thrower and a loud painful squeal. I care not to turn and see, but instead take my legs in my hands and keep running it towards a big tree. While running, I have the slight smell of Bacon in my nose, but due to the circumstances, i didnt further follow up on said thought, instead I hide behind the tree and look for the beast. In the background I can hear the sargent yell "Zarkk, help Victor! I take care of Alexej!".

Scorched by fire, hairs still buring, the beast is even more enraged at me and stampedes directly at me, but it seems to be somewhat weakend now. I take my chances and drop my pistol and reach for my combat knife. The moment it reaches me, i keep the tree between us while trying to take a slash at it. I was able to hit it, but its skin, charred and thick, seemed unimpressed by my attempt. "Fuck that!" and i ran towards the rest of the group, who, by now, seemed to have dealt with the rest of the rot and finally point their attention towards my struggle with the boarus giganticus. The private called Alexander vaults towards the boar with his knife, it seems he had a better swing at it and managed to actually pierce the skin of the boar. A lot of blood is gushing from the wound caused by the Privates Knife - an Artery must have been cut by that! It stumbles, growles and squaks, its getting weaker and weaker it falls. The beast is finally dead. 

## Aftermath

I hold my breath, look around, carefully listening to the environment, but the only sound we hear is the wind, who is rustling of the leaves of the trees... It seems like the fight is over. It takes a minute or two for everyone else to realise the same... slowly, one by one, the rest of the party eases up, getting out of their combat stance. "Lets cut them up and see what we can sell!" I hear Zarkks voice yell to the party. 

Quickly, before all the beasts are butchered up, i take my small camera and document some of those beasts. I approach the carcass of the Big Boar, which now lies in a puddle of his own blood with burned skin and a huge gunshot wound on its side. Next to it is Zarkk with his Knife in his hand, woundering how to even start cutting up a beast like that. He notices me and says "Hey, can you take a picture of it with me?". I agree and with a smile on his face, he pulls out his shotgun and props up a pose, with one foot on the beast. After i took the photo, he promises me some vodka, even raki as a thanks in return with a smile on his face.

Furthermore, I managed to take a picture of the Blind Dog, brought down by the  Sparkling anomaly. Its skin is covered in burnmarks caused by the heat of the electricity going through the deady body of the dog. With every pulse of the anomaly, the legs of dogs are slightly twitching. Slight smoke coming from its eyes and ears... "What a cuel way to go out" I think " but its better of dead then alive, thats for sure..".

I take another photo from the flesh that I shot. Two gunshot wounds. One in the face, where its eye used to be, the other on its side. Not many thoughts came to my mind here, as I was simply stunned by the creatures existance and appreance as a whole.

For the final photo, I step back and use my Medium Format Camera. I choose to frame the overall scene, the sun is low, the day is nearing its end. A cold breese is felt inbetween the trees. Sun rays can be seen breaching the cealing of leaves, siluetting the party at their work against the dark background of the forest. People are busy, cutting away at the beasts to harvest their hoofs, eyes, pelts and whatnot. Hot, white steam raises from where their skin has been pierced and their flesh is touching the air. Their remaining heat escaping their bodies. I take the photo and put away the camera, for a moment i hold and breath, observe the stage in front of me as everyone is cutting away quietly. 

Sasha, the Stalker that was tasked to watch over us walks up to me and joins me in watching the scene. "You know, I am quite impressed with what you did here, you know.. Knife Fighting a Boar... Not sure if thats stupidity or curage but it seems like Wolf was right to believe in you lot."

I muster the stalker next to me, constantly wearing the gasmask. With slight scepticism, I nod and walk away, reaching for my knife to join the groups effort...

# Day 2

## The Evening before

Once our party returned to Rookie Village, we turned to the trader to sell our haul. Each of us recieved their share of 100 Ruble from the return. Wolf came to us, as we've been at the trader. He says "Seems like you did well on your first little adventure. Sasha told me about the huge boar and the fact that it died to a final stroke with a knife! Not bad! As promised, you can ether have 1000 Rubles split between you guys, or, everyone of you gets one of those simple Anomaly Detectors. Might not be state of the art, but they surely will warn you when you're about to step into something bad!". Without much hesitation, the group quickly decided for the obvious. 1.000 Rubles might seem like a lot, but between us, its maybe a bottle of wodka each, the detectors on the other hand, will us actually give us a chance of survival. Wolf nods and points towards the trader and gestures tow him, who in turn reaches for a shabby cartboard box beneath the counter and hands out a detector to everyone. You can see that those are hand-made, soldered together her in the zone, but it seems that they are doing their job so you dont see a reason to complain. I take my detector and store it in a pouch of my belt, so that i can always hear when it starts detecting something dangerous.

After we finish our dealing with the trader, wolf invited us to join at the campfire. Once we sat down wolf looked at us and said "Okey guys, you did well for your first fight. I want to offer you another opportunity, but be warned, this will be a difficult fight with death watching over your shoulder. You dont have to, no one is forcing you, but we would apprechiate the support." Wolf takes a short break, looks at us, and as no one interjects he continues "There is a Yard not to far away from here, some bandits made it their camp and since their arrival, they've been quite a pain in the ass for us here at the Village. They keep assaulting our patrols and kill some of the newcomers that wander around here. And dont you worry, if you're in, we will attack as 3 groups.

"So, are you in?" Wolf asks. A few moments of silence, then Kodiak speaks up: "So those Bandits, if we cause truble with them, they're just scum of the zone, no one will care about us taking a couple of them out, right?" Wolf smurks. "Hah, if you say scum, you talk about the Renegades! They are even worse then the Brotherhood. But to be honest, the Brotherhood arent much better. But they kinda stick together. Word might go around. But they caused us a alot of trouble here in Rookie Village, thats why we kick them back to garbage!"
A few moments pass and Kodiak looks into the group. No one seems to show any signs of reservation, then Kodiak speaks up again: "Sure, I dont see any reason why this would be a disadvantage for us! Dangerous? Sure, but I'll bet there will be more dangerous things ahead of us and it wouldnt hurt to gain some expierence, get familiar with the bad actors in this place here!". 

Wolf nods with a subtle  smile. "Happy to hear! We'll be attacking tomorrow in the morning, at that time, the bandits are usually still asleep and all together in the yard, but more on that later! I have to do some preparations. I will meet you tomorrow!" Wolf stands up and leaves the campfire, heading towards on of the basements of the village. A few minutes pass, then Zarkk reaches for this backpack and pulls out a bottle of wodka and with a grin on his face, he offers it to me, as I sit next to him. With a wide smirk, pull out my metal cup from my backpack and pore me a shot while Zarkk pulls out his cup and i proceed to pore into his cup and offer the bottle to the sargent next to me. ... The bottle makes its round and we finally ease up and start to chatter, telling each other about our experience from the recent Hunt and some time passes...

"Kodiak, that was decent shot!" The Sargent said towards me. I nod with a humble smile "Thanks!" as I notice some voices from the entrance of the village and look up from the campfire towards the entrance. I can hear the guards greeting a new arrival - by the reaction of the guards, he seems to be no stranger to the people here. When he walked by the campfire, I could muster his appreance. Long trenchcoat, some armored vest beneath. He wears an eyepatch, covering one of his. Did he loose it? A recent wound? The patch shows signs of age. Maybe even as old as him. His skin, his beard speak for his age, but he seems well equipped, far beyond our lousy equipment. The arrivial of such an unusual figure at the camp attractes my attention and after noticing that he is walking towards the basement where Wolf disappeared earlier, my mind was set. With a quite voice I say to Zarkk and Sarge "Excuse me for a moment, I'll be back in a minute" and stand up and with cautious steps I walk over to the basement. Hiding near the entrance, I lean towards the voices I can hear. I try to catch on the conversaion that takes place inside the basement as I can hear an argument between Wolf and, presumably, the Old Man. I can only make our the strangers words, as he speaks with little regard for prying ears while Wolfs tries to remain subtle.

"They are just stories." ... "Be careful, what paradise you wish for, what hope you give to other stalkers."... "...in the search they just make it real". Another snippet evolves around something about "the men in white". Focused on the conversation, I notice someone coming from the direction I came from I turn around to see who is coming. 

"Hey, what are you doing?" Private Alexander calls to me with a slight mumble in his voice. It seems that he had a little too much vodka already. His steps arent the straightest anymore as he steps towards me. Quickly, I raise my finger to my lips to sign him to be quite "Shssh". In that moment he his leg trips over the surfaced roof of nearby tree and falls face first towards the floor. An audible thud can be heared on impact. The voices from the Basement quiet down, chairs are being moverd. I quickly step over to the Private and say loudly with a sigh "Had to much to drink, ey?" as I help him up "Here, let me help you up." With one arm I hold the Private, who is still a bit dazed from the fall, with the other, I reach for my small Camera, and hold it over under my arm, pointing towards the entrance of the basement. "Dont get lost, or a mutant will bite of your parts!" I look over my shoulder and see the old Stalker who is walking away from the basement, looking over his shoulder towards us. I press the trigger of the camera, a sublte click is to be heard, but I speak up, to overtone the sound, towards the private "Dont get lost, or a mutant will bite of your parts!" as I walk him back to the campfire...

## The Next Morning

During the next morning most of us woke up when the sun came out. A slight headache acompanied my morning but after washing my face and brushing my teeth with some bottled water I purchased from the trader the evening before and drinking the rest, it was mostly gone. 

I start preparing my belonging and packing up my sleeping spot. Afterwards I join the rest of my party outside by the campfire and join them in their preparations. I start cleaning and preparing the hunting rifle, checking my Makarov magazines and put my rounds for the rifle in my belt pouch so I can easily reach them mid fight. Most of us are here, just the Private is still missing. "Hey Sarge, have you seen the Private yet?" "No, he drank way to much yesterday. I hope he doesnt get us killed." He stated with slight frustration.

Wolf was already up and busy and instructing people for the raid today. "Sasha, I need you to go and meetup with the watchpost near the bandit camp. Meet with the new comers around 9am west of the yard. I will take some of my guys here and get in position to assault from the other side. We will move in the moment we hear gunfire."

Shortly afterwards, Wolf approaches our group with another stranger next to him. She isnt very tall, quite the oposite. She seems a bit lost, not really knowing what is going on. She seems to be in her early 20s, rather small around 5" with a small frame, auburn red hair knotted in a bun and hazelnut brown eyes.

"This is Aris, another newcomer to the camp, I want her to tag along with you." We nod. "Okey guys, here is the plan... " as Wolf continues instruct us on the plan. "... You'll be there first, be careful and scout out the place. My team will attack from the other side once we hear gunfire. They wont expect us, as they're usually still hung over at this time of the day, so lets take our chances and do it right! Lets move out in 10 Minutes" We nod. 

"Alright, where is this slacker?" The Sarge steps away from the group with his metal cup in his hand. He fills it with wather from some old rain barrel and steps towards another house on the other side of the street. We can hear a supprised scream as we see the Sargent through the broken window, throwing the water on the floor infront of him. "Wake up! We're leaving 5 Minutes! Get your shit together or we'll leave you behind!"


## The Yard

We arrived near the yard rather soon. Its about 10 minutes before 9. We observe the surroundings froma hidden spot nearby and we can see guys guarding the entrance, a fence around the compound and a couple of buildings inside. Besides the two guards we dont see any movement but we can see some smoke coming up from the chimneys. Seams like someone's home.
There is a hole in the fence at the right corner of the yard. We discuss our approach. The Sargent and me tent towards the entrance, to take care of the guards there once the fighting starts and to cause a distraction, the rest will try to sneak in through the hole in the fence to the right. 5 Minutes to 9. Its time for us to move. The sarge and me sneak up towards the road. I position myself right of the road, the sarge crosses and hides behind a tree to the left and we wait.

I take the opportunity to take a quick picture and pull out my large camera. I frame the photograph with the Sargent as he carefully peakes from the cover of a tree towards the entrance of the Bandit Camp. In the Background, the road that leads towards the gate of the yard and some Bandits behind some fallen treetrunks, guarding the gate.

The left guard holds a simple Pistol, while the right one has a sawn-off shotgun. I pack up my camera and get in ready position. Looking towards the Sarge, i notice him watching towards the guards, then looking towards me. I wave to him, point at my chest, then to the guards, then to the right. He nods and I get aim down the sight.

Now its time to wait. Sasha's group should be here now any moment but so far nothing. I hope they didnt got caught or somehow delayed. It would be nice to maintain the advantage of supprise. A few moments pass and then we hear a "Thud" from the right, where the whole in the fence is. "Fuck, What was that?" As we look towards the source. It through some bushes and branches, i can see the Private on the Floor, it seems like the stumbled and fell... *again*. "Shit, we should have left him in the camp, i thought". 

The guards look raise their head, looking towards the source of disturbance, but it seems the Private remained hidden form their sight. They look at each other and then, the one with the shotgun starts walking towards the the right to investigate the cause.

With slight panic in my eyes I look towards Sargent, who just pulled out his pistol and is readying his stance. He looks towards the guard, then to me, he nods and I return the nod. "Here goes nothing" as I breath out to hold my breath and slowly pull the trigger.

A loud bang, the guard is hit in the side of his Torso. He looks bad, but he is still standing. He musters his remaining strengh and vaults into cover to a nearby tree. Before the other guy could react, the Sarge raises from his cover and puts another bullet to the wounded guard who drops drops down to the ground.

The remaining guard, supprised and shocked, rushes to the nearest cover. In the distance, on the far side of the bandit camp we can hear another firefight to erupt - seems like Wolfs team is reliable and entered the fight!

As I reload my rifle, I observe the firefight between the sarge and the secound guard, put the bullet in the barrel and close the weapon. I ready myself and push the buttstock in my shoulder to take a shot at the remaining guard, when suddenly, a group of 4 more bandits and push the gate open and line up on the road. On of them, a bigger guy wields a sawn-off shotgun while the rest of them only have pistols. I refocus my attention on the guy with the sawn-off and take the shot. Bang. The guy still stands. "Fuck, a miss." The big guy, as well as the sawn off guy walk towards me with their gun at their shoulder. Before I could contemplate my the pityful situation I have found myself in, two, rapid loud bangs shatter the tense situation. The Sarge's unloaded both his barrels into those bandits. One lies dead on the ground, while the big guy stumbles from nearly falling. Another bandit at the gate takes a shot but misses the Sarge, as he yells at the bandits "Learn to shoot, fuckers" and dashes to seek some distance and cover away from the big guy and i rush to reload my rifle again.

The big guy, while surely hurt from suddenly being buck-shotted on such short range, he sure as hell seemed to be as pissed as he is in pain. He rightens himself up and his eyes are staring towards him, who has caused such pain. From beneath his coat, he pulls something small, the size of a big potato. He wraps his first around it and reaches with his other hand towards the top of said potato. "Fuck. Grenade!" the sarge yells while vaulting behind a tree. Finally, with another round inside my barrel, I aim at the big guy, to take out the threat. 

I aim at this head, this guy needs to go away. I steady my stance and breath out but then, i change my mind. I lower the rifle and aim at the Grenade, which he hold in front of his chest, about to be unpinned... 

I breath in...
I breath out...
He pulled the pin on the grenade...
I hold my breath...
I pull the trigger.

For the blink of an eye, silence.
Then, a bright flash and a loud "Boom".

The guy disapears into nothing but a cloud of dust.
I hunker down behind the tree from the debries raining down around.

A many small stones hit the tree and the floor around me, but also some bigger, more meatier , but then, there is a more meaty sound and i see how a torn off finger
