## Post Aftermath


Rostok:
Old Factory north of Rookie, 100 Rads Bar

Faction called Duty that controls it


Way to Rostok:
Through Garbage: under control by the bandits

Through Agro Prom: Research Facility, currently Off-LImits by the Military on High Aleart.


What to worry about rostok:
-nothing
-avoid duty, tyrants or matryrs and heros. Dont get cought with artefacts there/artefact hunting. Not fans of artefact hunting. But Duty pays well for hunting mutants.


What kind of work does sydrovitch give out?
-mutant, artefact hunts.
-currier jobs
-hitjobs for stalker who ended up bad

About duty:
- easy to ID, Black Cloth with Red Highlights. Patch.
- Ex military, after they have been stationed here post Zone.
- Want to destroy the zone, contain it, want to make sure the horrors of the zone, radiation and monsters stay inside.
- But also help out when people are chased by mutants like chrimera.
  

What is a chimera?
- Imagine a Lion, add 3 heads without a mane, make it terrifying, remove all the hair, and make it 3x faster. Took duty 3-4 people to take it down.

What are artefacts?
- Are they valuable? Yes, a ton. Need some gear to collect them, container, artefact detector.
- Right Tools & Skills

Sparklers are also called tesla or electra.
