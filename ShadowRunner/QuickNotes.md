## Contact Lenses
### Image Link
This lets you display visual information (text,
pictures, movies, the current time, etc.) in your
field of vision. This is usually done with AROs, but
you can display pretty much whatever you want
on it. You and your team can use it to share tactical
and situational info in real time. An image link is
what you need to truly “see” AR and participate in
the modern world.

### Flare Comensation
An implanted version of the flare compensation
enhancement (p. 275).

This protects you from blinding flashes of
light as well as simple glare. This modification
offers a bonus Edge if the opposition doesn’t
have a vision enhancement to mitigate glare and
reduces the penalty from flashing lights, like
from a flash-pak.

### Vision Magification
This zoom function digitally magnifies vision
by up to fifty times, allowing distant targets to be
seen clearly. Attack Ratings for Medium, Far, and
Extreme ranges are increased by 2, assuming the
attack being used has a non-zero Attack Rating in
those categories.


## Glasses
### Smartlink
This is the vision accessory side of the smartgun
system (p. 260). The smartlink receives the range to
various targets, ammunition level (and type), and
offers a targeting dot wherever the gun is pointed
if within the visual field of the user.

### Vision Enhancement
This zoom function digitally magnifies vision
by up to fifty times, allowing distant targets to be
seen clearly. Attack Ratings for Medium, Far, and
Extreme ranges are increased by 2, assuming the
attack being used has a non-zero Attack Rating in
those categories.

## Ear Buds
These ergonomic earplugs are hard to spot
and harder still to differentiate from the standard
kind that comes with every music player
and commlink.

### Spatial Recognizer
This hearing accessory pinpoints the source of
a sound. You get a bonus Edge on your Perception
tests to find the source of a specific sound, but if you
do not spend the Edge immediately, it goes away.
Wireless bonus: You get a +1 dice pool modifier
to your audio Perception Tests when looking for a
sound’s source. This can be combined with other
dice pool modifiers.

### Audio enhancement
Audio enhancement allows the user to hear a
broader spectrum of frequencies, including high
and low frequencies outside the normal metahuman
audible spectrum. The user also experiences
fine discrimination of nuances and can block out
distracting background noise. This system gives a
+1 dice pool bonus to all aural Perception tests.


## Laser Microphone
This sensor bounces a laser against a thin, solid
object like a windowpane, reads the vibrations on
the surface, and translates them into the sounds
that are occurring on the other side of the surface.
Maximum range is one hundred meters.

### Select Sound Filter Rtg. 3
This system blocks out background noise
and can focus on specific sounds or patterns of
sounds. It even includes speech, word, and sound
pattern recognition. The system can load a number
of select sounds up to its rating (such as the
footsteps of a patrolling guard, a particular word,
or the rotors of a distant helicopter). You only
actively listen to one group at a time, but you can
record the others for later playback or set them to
trigger an alert if they are activated. The system
can have a rating of 1 to 3.

### Audio Enhancement

## Attachments

#### Smartgun System
This is the firearm or a projectile-weapon side of
the smartlink system. The system includes a small
camera and range finder. It keeps track of ammunition and, 
through DNI, allows switching between
gun modes, ejecting a clip, and firing the gun without
pulling the trigger. The camera allows you to
fire from cover, suffering no Attack test penalties
while affected by the Cover Status. If you’re using a
smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun’s
Attack Rating by 2 across all available range categories.
The smartgun features are accessed either
by universal access port cable to an imaging device
(like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with
cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in
concert with direct neural interface. Internal smartgun
systems add 500 nuyen to the weapon price. An
external smartgun system can be attached to the top
mount or underbarrel mount with an Engineering +
Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera
has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision
enhancements (p. 275).
Wireless bonus: You gain a +1 dice pool bonus.
Gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you
use the Reload Smartgun or Change Device Mode
actions to eject a clip or change fire mode.

#### Tripod
The tripod provides a stable base to fire a weapon
low to the ground with the user kneeling or
sitting. A tripod can be attached to the underbarrel
mount. It negates the Attack Rating adjustments
for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and offers a +3 Attack
Rating for Full-Auto when properly deployed.
Attaching a tripod takes a Major Action. Folding
up or deploying the bipod is a Minor Action.
Wireless bonus: The player gains a free Minor
Action on a turn when they fold up, deploy, or remove
the tripod.


## Ammunition
### APDS
Armor-piercing discarding sabot is a mouthful,
which is why the APDS acronym is used so frequently.
The sabot allows for high muzzle velocities
pushing an ultra-hard penetrator designed to punch
through armor. APDS is rarely made caseless because
the sabot shells are left lying around anyway.

### Stick-n-Shock
Stick-n-Shock rounds make any regular weapon
a taser. They deal Stun damage and apply the
Zapped status but don’t carry the punch of the
regular round.



## GEAR

### Autopicker
This lockpick gun is a quick and effective way
of bypassing mechanical locks. The autopicker lets
you add +1 as a dice pool modifier to your test
when picking a mechanical lock.

# Actions
## Minor Actions
### Take Aim (I)
A character gains a +1 dice pool bonus with the
use of this action. The action can only be taken once
per combat round, but if the bonus is not used, it
carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to
be combined with actions taken over the course of
several combat round. If the character takes a player
turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions,
any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are lost. 

The maximum dice pool bonus from the use of
this action is equal to the character’s Willpower. 

A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow,
or exotic ranged weapon.
If the character is using image magnification
or a targeting scope, the Take Aim action must be
used to line up the shot in order to receive any
bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of
Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus
beyond enabling the function of the modification.

### Dodge (A)
A character can add their Athletics skill to a single
Defense test in combat. The roll must happen
in the same player turn in which the action is used.

## Call a Shot (I)
Edge allows for some specific called shots without
dice penalty or with reduced penalty, but you
can increase the damage by 2 by taking a –4 dice
pool penalty. This must be combined with the Attack
action.

## Toxins
### Nausea Gas
• Vector: Inhalation
• Speed: 3 combat rounds
• Duration: (6 – Body) minutes, minimum 1
minute
• Power: 9
• Effect: Dazed status, Nauseated status
Used as a riot control agent, this gas causes
nausea and a crippling need to vomit. Nausea gas
becomes inert after two minutes of contact with
the air.
