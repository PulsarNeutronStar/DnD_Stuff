balance in your soul, heart, qi, brain chemistry, etc.
• Bonus: 10 Karma
• Game Effect: You cannot spend or earn Edge
for twenty-four hours after you break a tenet
of your code. If the same tenet is broken
multiple times or broken again during the

twenty-four. If a different tenet is broken,
it’s twenty-four hours for that one added
to any current infractions, and the same
rules apply for additional violations. See the
Honorbound sidebar for some sample codes
and tenets.

Level 2 dependents
    are more stable costs, like the support

#### Insomnia
    Sleep? What’s that? It could be nightmares,
    brain damage, funky biochemistry, or a psychological
    disorder, but no matter the reason, you just
    can’t get a good night’s rest.
• Bonus: 4 Karma
• Game Effect: Without proper rest, you can’t
    regain Edge or spend it as you might like.
    Each day the runner must make a Body +
    Willpower (3) test to get a successful night
    of rest. If they fail, they cannot earn more
    than two Edge from any source that day.
    Also, they cannot spend more than 2 Edge
    on any given test. The purchase and use of
    a sleep regulator reduces the threshold on
    the test to 1. The runner can also purchase
    medication (50 nuyen/dose) that reduces
    the threshold to 2.

#### Social Stress
There is a social situation that simply does
not work for you, like being in large groups,
talking to new people, being the center of attention,
being out of the spotlight, or a myriad of

made against you gain a bonus Edge.
